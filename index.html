  <h1>Moderator Application – Reliable, Multilingual & Community-Focused</h1>

  <textarea id="recipient" placeholder="Dear [Server Owner/Community Team],"></textarea>

  <div id="letter">
    <p>My name is Sreekarthik Randheesh, though I am best known online as Karthik. I’m a 13-year-old student and content creator with a passion for community engagement, and I would like to formally apply for a Moderator position within your Discord server or Roblox community.</p>

    <p>Over the past year, I’ve gained hands-on experience managing my own community and assisting in others:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 year of moderation experience in a Discord server of 100+ members (now archived, from an earlier account).</li>
      <li>2 months of moderation in a Roblox game with an active player base of 200–500 users.</li>
      <li>Current owner of a server called NeonSynk, where I manage engagement, support members, and handle rule enforcement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am fluent in English, Malayalam, Tamil, and Hindi (both spoken and written), and can also communicate in spoken Urdu, which enables me to assist a wide and diverse player/user base effectively. My strengths include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Answering player and member questions in a clear, respectful, and patient manner.</li>
      <li>Maintaining fairness while handling rule violations.</li>
      <li>Creating a welcoming atmosphere for new users and encouraging a positive environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While I’m not available on Fridays and Saturdays, I am active at various times throughout the rest of the week and can respond promptly to server or community needs.</p>

    <p>Moderating is not just a role I want—it’s a responsibility I value. I’ve always aspired to be part of something bigger, where I can use my strengths to help others, solve problems, and ensure that everyone has a fair and positive experience within the game or server. I take my role seriously and act with integrity, professionalism, and respect at all times.</p>

    <p>If selected, I will do my absolute best to represent your community with maturity and commitment. Thank you for considering my application—I would be glad to answer any further questions or participate in a trial if required.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,<br/>
    Karthik (Sreekarthik Randheesh)</p>
