    <h1>Final Moderator Application Message</h1>
    <h3>Moderator Application – Reliable, Multilingual & Community-Focused</h3>
    <p>Dear [Server Owner/Community Team],</p>
    <p>My name is Sreekarthik Randheesh, though I am best known online as Karthik. I’m a 13-year-old student and content creator with a passion for community engagement, and I would like to formally apply for a Moderator position within your Discord server or Roblox community.</p>
    <p>Over the past year, I’ve gained hands-on experience managing my own community and assisting in others:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 year of moderation experience in a Discord server of 100+ members (now archived).</li>
      <li>2 months of moderation in a Roblox game with 200–500 users.</li>
      <li>Current owner of NeonSynk server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am fluent in English, Malayalam, Tamil, and Hindi, and can also communicate in spoken Urdu. My strengths include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Answering questions clearly and patiently.</li>
      <li>Maintaining fairness in rule enforcement.</li>
      <li>Creating a welcoming atmosphere for users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While I’m not available on Fridays and Saturdays, I’m active during the rest of the week and can respond promptly to community needs.</p>
    <p>Moderating is not just a role—it’s a responsibility. I take it seriously and act with integrity, professionalism, and respect at all times.</p>
    <p>If selected, I’ll do my best to represent your community with maturity and dedication. Thank you for considering my application—I’m open to further questions or a trial.</p>
